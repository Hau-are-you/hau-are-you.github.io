    <!-- Project Description -->
    <section class="project-description fade-up">
      <p>I was responsible for the 3D modelling and technical design of a detailed 1:12 scale Safety Doll House, created as an educational tool to raise awareness of electrical fire hazards at shows and events.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The house measured 1100 x 1100 x 1100 mm and was designed from scratch in Rhino. The base was CNC-cut from marine MDF for durability, while the carcass was produced in 15 mm acrylic with a tab and slot system for easy assembly. Floors were made from laser-engraved maple veneer for a realistic finish, and resin-printed roof tiles added further detail and texture.</p>
      <br>
      <p>All furniture was custom-designed, 3D printed, laser-cut, and hand-assembled, including fine details such as a bubble bath and resin-cast makeup desk bulbs. Some walls were left transparent, allowing the interior to be viewed easily.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The final model successfully combined durability with realism, serving as a highly effective educational exhibit on electrical safety.</p>
